## Task Description
The primary objective is to classify the speakers from the provided dataset accurately. This involves preprocessing the data, training a Transformer model on the speaker features, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Data Preparation
The dataset used in this project contains features extracted from audio samples of various speakers. The preparation process includes:

- Cleaning and normalizing the data.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.

## Model Building
For this classification task, a Transformer model is employed. The Transformer model, known for its self-attention mechanism, is particularly suited for handling the sequential nature of speaker data. The model architecture includes:

- An embedding layer to convert input features into dense vectors.
- Several Transformer blocks, each consisting of multi-head self-attention mechanisms and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks.
- A final output layer to classify the speakers.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Detailed analysis through confusion matrices and ROC curves provides insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses in classifying speakers.

## Conclusion
The Transformer model demonstrates promising results in classifying speakers, highlighting the potential of advanced deep learning architectures in the field of audio analysis. Future work could explore further optimizations, the inclusion of more diverse data, and comparisons with other model architectures.
